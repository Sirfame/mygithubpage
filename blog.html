        Decided to start a blog. Still don’t know how to actually host it correctly, so it’s gonna be static for now. My story here will start at the end of high school, where I did a mediocre job for four years and managed to get into the University of Washington. Didn’t really know what to study so I dabbled around with the natural sciences before I settled on the intro CS courses. I did not have the work ethic and smarts to get into CS however, but for the first two years of college I BS’d enough to get into Informatics. Once I got in however, I really stopped trying - think absolute bare minimum to graduate. I was in a frat and I thought I was too cool to get to know people in my major, so I went to my classes alone. End of junior year, I somehow talked my way into a software internship at Concur for the summer. Still didn’t try, at all. Barely knew anything but too proud to ask for help. Came in late, watched an hour of Netflix a day, left early. Made fun of another guy who did absolutely nothing. As soon as my paychecks came in, I spent it all on handles of Jose Cuervo and black out every weekend with my bros. School starts again and all I did my senior year was go out to the bar three times a week, never missed a frat party, and failed a class. During spring break, I got a call from T-Mobile saying they would like me to intern there for the summer as a business analyst. Tf? Sure. Then I graduated, and started the internship. Worked on a BS ASP.NET web application to parse through Active Directory to display org charts, but nothing related to BA work. Team decides to keep me after the internship ends since I’m dirt cheap headcount, but still as an intern for four more months before they finally extended a full time offer to me, as an Associate Software Engineer. Started working on custom development work for SharePoint Online, mix of C# console applications and custom front end dev. Fast forward 2 years, and I’m still here as an Associate, no promotion, no raise. Today I worked on adding a CSS rule that changes a link to purple when you hover over it.

        To say that I am deeply disappointed in myself is an understatement. For a long period of time, I thought about killing myself every single day. But having survived my friends suicide in college, I knew deep down that was not a real path for me to go down, it's way too painful for everyone around. That cloud has since passed (thank god), because I actually created goals for myself and have been taking small steps every day to get myself closer to that goal. For one, I start my day at 4:15 AM and head to the gym. After my workout, I read for 20 minutes in the sauna, and then head home. I usually get home around 6:50 AM and start working on iOS development. Then I go to work and waste 8 hours working on nothing important. After work, I stay an extra hour to practice whiteboarding classic data structure and algorithm problems in preparation for my next opportunity. Then I go home and try to organize or clean my living space before my nightly offshore sync up where I listen to more unimportant updates for another hour, before finally I pass out from exhaustion. Still working on the sustainability part of my daily schedule, but it’s starting to take shape, as I am much happier now than I was just a few months ago.

        I’m not sure if I will do well on my assessment for Amazon next week, I’m not sure when my next opportunity will be. But I know one thing though. I know my mom did not cram into a 12 foot long fishing boat with 50 other refugees from a war-torn Vietnam, and my dad did not come to America empty handed and learned English one dictionary look up at a time so that their child could end up at a dead end job changing the color of fucking anchor tags. I’m not going to be mediocre anymore, I will be great.
